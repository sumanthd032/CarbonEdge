# CarbonEdge 

CarbonEdge is an **AI + Industrial IoT–based energy optimization platform** designed to detect hidden energy inefficiencies in industrial plants such as cement, steel, and manufacturing units.

Traditional SCADA systems rely on basic alarms and often miss subtle performance drifts. CarbonEdge continuously learns machine behavior and provides **real-time, actionable insights** to reduce energy waste, CO₂ emissions, and operational costs.

## Key Features

* **AI-powered anomaly & drift detection**
* **Energy Behavior Modeling (EBM)** for machines
* **Multi-sensor data fusion** (temperature, vibration, pressure, power)
* **Real-time dashboards & alerts**
* **Root-cause analysis and optimization recommendations**
* **ESG, energy, and CO₂ efficiency reports**
* **Offline-friendly operator UI**

---

## How It Works

1. Collects high-frequency sensor data from industrial equipment
2. Learns normal operating patterns using AI models
3. Detects hidden inefficiencies before alarms trigger
4. Provides precise corrective actions (RPM tuning, VFD adjustment, leak detection)
5. Visualizes impact through dashboards and reports
